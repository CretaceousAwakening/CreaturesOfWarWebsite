      <description>Creatures Of War has been announced! When developing this game I wanted to focus on tightly controlled tense combat situations requiring precise dodge mechanics, speed burst / grenade usage optimizations for creating space, and of course high powered weaponry that can bring down even the toughest of enemies.
When I thought to myself about creating a 2D combat system I knew that the gameplay was the most important aspect of the gameâ€™s development process.</description>
